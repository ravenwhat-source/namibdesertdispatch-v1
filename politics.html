    <p><strong>ONJEZU, EPUPA CONSTITUENCY –</strong> Onjezu’s inhabitants claim that the government has abandoned them, with the exception of election season, in the untamed and remote Kunene Region of Namibia.</p>

    <p>The lack of roads, doctors and other necessary amenities has made it difficult to survive in this isolated community on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>To receive medical care, villagers must travel more than 100 kilometers on foot or by donkey to the Etanga Clinic. They go between 70 and 80 kilometers to Otjitanda or Okauwa to get food to help with the drought. The trips are lengthy, taxing, and frequently hazardous, especially for expectant mothers, the elderly, and those with infants.</p>

    <p>Tjongwana Tjambiru, a 37-year-old local, told this reporter that the community only feels acknowledged during national elections. “Only during elections do they claim that we are Namibians. Only when they arrive to deliver ballot boxes every five years do we see helicopters. We’re totally forgotten after that,” he remarked.</p>

    <p>“Even though they say there are no roads, they manage to get voting materials to us. Why are they unable to deliver food and medicine to us in the same manner?”</p>

    <p>Access to Onjezu is made much more challenging by its location next to the Kunene River and surrounded by rugged mountains. In dire circumstances, locals swim over the river to Angola, a nearby village council territory, to get assistance. But as they are not Angolan citizens, many are denied entry. Tjambiru went on, “We’re risking our lives just to survive.”</p>

    <p>Residents say their appeals to the government have gone unanswered. They feel exploited—valued only for their votes and forgotten as soon as the ballots are counted. “They only come when it’s time to vote. Once the elections are over, we don’t see or hear from them again,” said Tjambiru.</p>

    <p>“If they had the political will, they would use the same energy and resources they use during elections to deliver clinics, food, roads, and clean water.”</p>

    <p>The residents of Onjezu are calling for long-term answers as the country’s elections draw near. They demand significant funding for basic infrastructure, healthcare access, and rural development.</p>

    <p>Tjambiru remarked, “We are sick of being utilized and ignored. We are also Namibians.”</p>

    <p>As the nation prepares to head to the polls, the situation in Onjezu highlights a deeper crisis of unequal development—and a plea from the margins not to be ignored again.</p>
