      The Between A Rock and a Hard Place (BARHP) Festival that took place from 25 to 27 April, 2025 turned the iconic Spitzkoppe mountains into a vibrant sonic wonderland.
      The BARHP team described the vast sonic landscape at the festival as an “electronic music experience bringing you local and international DJs”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DJs at the BARHP festival spun a wide range of genres including Afro House, Afro Tech, Deep House, Disco Tech, Tech House, and Techno.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BARHP Festival lineup was packed with talent from across the globe. Namibian DJs like Bisskitt, DJ Dreas, and YD Fresh featured in the festival lineup.
      South African DJs like Digital Sangoma, DJ Sands, and Ryan Hill also featured. International DJs like Noazem (from Germany), Piezu (from Finland), and Vikii (from Spain) featured too.

    <p>
      Eliud Andima (22) was one of the many festival goers. He shared his experience at the BARHP festival.
      “This was my second time at BARHP and I had a blast. It feels like all the right people are in one place and we get to have a nonstop party all day.
      It’s super safe, the people are the friendliest, and the music lineup is always epic,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BARHP festival was about so much more than electronic music. The festival also embraced art, community, and fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Thank you for all you beautiful souls that stayed up to dance with me into the morning,” said YD Fresh on 2 May, 2025.
